# odoo-8-contract-management

This module is not for production purposes.
It's just a sample.
Just install it.
    
It creates 3 users in the three following roles :
* Worker
* Author
* Manager
    
The password is the letter a (awesome security level ^^)
    
Don't forget to :
* Change the default email addresses specified in the demo partner's data
* Modify the default SMTP server settings for outgoing emails or delete and replace it by explicit command line arguments.
=> Odoo 8 requires that no SMTP server has been defined for using the SMTP command line arguments.
* Specify a valid value for the 'email_from' parameter or the server won't be able to send messages.
    
I didn't put the demo data reference in the proper attribute 'demo' for convenience reasons.
  
Enjoy
